# 👋 Hi, I'm Aidan Manternach

I'm a **Software Engineer** at the **University of California San Diego**, currently pursuing my **M.S. in Machine Learning and Data Science**.
I’m passionate about building intelligent systems that bridge the gap between **software engineering** and **machine learning**.  

I enjoy designing performant systems, experimenting with new technologies, and turning complex ideas into elegant solutions.  
My experience ranges from **production-level distributed systems** to **AI-driven applications**, and I’m always looking for ways to learn and grow as an engineer.
